## Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The goal of this project is to deliver an app-based inventory system. The app will allow users to log in to the app. If the user has not established a login account, the app will provide a page to create an account. Once login, the user can add or remove items, increase or decrease item quantity, and set alerts. The alert can be configured to notify the user when an item quantity has reached zero. The app will store the login information and the item data in a database.

## What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The app needs to be designed to be inclusive to all users. The font sizes should be large enough to be easily readable. The button should be easily selectable. The button and labels should be placed where the useability is not affected if the user is right or left-handed. The color scheme should be designed for people with color vision deficiency.

## How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
I attempted to apply incremental development techniques. I made small changes and then tested the application thoroughly.

## How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
I tested the applications by entering what I would expect users to enter, then started trying edge cases that I would not expect users to enter.

## Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
The most challenging aspect was that this was my first time working on Android. Something as simple as opening a database took much research to figure out how.

## In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
The CRUD functions are very important as most businesses information is stored in databases. Knowing how to interact with databases is very important in professional development.
